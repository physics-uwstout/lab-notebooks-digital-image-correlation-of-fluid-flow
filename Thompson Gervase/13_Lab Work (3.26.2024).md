Brendan gave his project update presentation this morning. During the Q/A session, Dr. Zimmerman brought up a good point regarding some troubles we encountered while running the experiment. He suggested that we play around with the orientation of the magnets relative to the copper strips and see how the system behaves at different voltage levels.

The magnet and copper strip setup we were replicating from the [[KELLEY_1.PDF]] research paper can be seen below.

Today we ran the experiments with the setup set to orientation #2.

**Run #1**
- Parameters
	- Voltage: 30.5 [V]
	- Current: 0.15 [A]

**Run #2**
- Parameters
	- Voltage: 61.4 [V]
	- Current: 0.47 [A]
![[Lab_13_61.4V_0.67A.MOV]]

**Run #3**
- Parameters
	- Voltage: 92.1 [V]
	- Current: 1.75 [A]
![[Lab_13_92.1V_1.75A.mov]]


**Run #4
- Parameters
	- Voltage: 122.82 [V]
	- Current: 3.65 [A]

The results of these test runs were similar to those seen with the orientation #1 setup. However, the flow seemed to be choppier. Looking back at the [[KELLEY_1.PDF]] research paper, I am questioning the copper/magnet orientations I presented up above. We need to dissect our grouping of magnets to see what is really going on underneath a layer of tape. This will help solidify our understanding of the experimental setup.
