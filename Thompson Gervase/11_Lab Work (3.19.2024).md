Today we are going to try and re-run the experiment with the solution parameters defined by the [[KELLEY_1.PDF]] research paper. However, this time we adjusted the copper strips used in the experimental setup. From our previous experimental trials, we noticed that the copper strips had some gunk on them and needed to be cleaned up. We also decided to raise the level at which the copper strip bends to make an L-shape in order to increase the copper's surface area underneath the solution.

The original copper strips are shown below.

These copper strips were then flattened out and the surfaces were cleaned up with some steel wool lying around the lab.

Following that, we used a vice and a hammer to re-bend the strips to a rough 90$\degree$. The 90$\degree$ bend point was higher than the original to increase the surface area of the copper in contact with the solution.

The electrolytic solution was then remixed to replicate the [[KELLEY_1.PDF]] research paper.
Calculated Parameters:
	- 28 [g] of Copper Sulfate (10% of the total solution mass)
	- 191.9 [mL] of Distilled Water
	- 47.97 [mL] of Glycerol (20% of the total solution volume)

A heating pad with built in magnetic stirrer was used to expedite the mixing process. 
	- Stirring Parameters
		- RPM: 800
		- Temperature: 100$\degree$C

0.1 grams of glass beads were used to cover the electrolytic solution.

**Error Source:**
We noticed an error source within our experimental setup. This error was driven by our power supplies. The grounding clip was engaged for each power supply limiting the amount of voltage getting to the electrolytic solution. In the future, make sure that those grounding clips are disconnected.

We tried to send those videos through the [[Student Lab Notebooks/lab-notebooks-digital-image-correlation-of-fluid-flow/Thompson Gervase/Misc Files/PIV Guided Notebook.ipynb|PIV Guided Notebook]] script for the first time. However, it did not go as smoothly as we had hoped. We need to re-adjust some parameters to accommodate our video files.
