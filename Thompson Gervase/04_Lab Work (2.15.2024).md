Today we worked on linking our lab notebooks in Obsidian with GitHub. It was a pain at first but we got it figured out.

We are still waiting on copper sulfate to run our experiment.

The rest of the day, I read the following research paper to get a better understanding of particle tracking: [[A quantitative study of three-dimensional Lagrangian particle tracking.pdf]]

Questions from reading
	- Lagrangian vs Eulerian 
		- Lagrangian deals more with individual particles
		- Eulerian deals more with groups of particles
