Today we filled out our application for research day.

The epoxy used to prevent the leaks on our acrylic container have cured. There was still a slight leak that needs to be fixed. Instead of epoxy this time, we used hot glue to fix the leak.

We were able to set up and run the experiment for the first time. This round was based on the [[KELLEY_1.PDF]] research paper. The following electrolytic solution was created: 

Calculated Parameters:
	- 28 [g] of Copper Sulfate (10% of the total solution mass)
	- 191.9 [mL] of Distilled Water
	- 47.97 [mL] of Glycerol (20% of the total solution volume)

Our experimental setup can be seen below. There was one power supply for the LEDs within the enclosure. Two additional power supplies were daisy chained to drive the flow of the electrolytic solution.

Two different power parameters were used to conduct the experiment. For the first experiment, 40 [V] and roughly 400 [mA] were supplied to the electrolytic solution ([[IMG_1564.jpg]]). For the second experiment, 60 [V] and roughly 800 [mA] were supplied to the electrolytic solution ([[IMG_1566.jpg]]). 

The resulting videos collected from those two experiments can be seen below.

The videos did not turn out the best compared to the example video we were given. There may have been some sources of error causing these inconsistencies. Next time we will try cleaning the electrodes with some steel wool, leveling out the fluid levels, and limiting the amount of glass beads being used.
