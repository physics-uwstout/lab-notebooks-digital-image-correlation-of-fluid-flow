Today the plan is to test run another experiment. During [[09_Lab Work (3.5.2024)]], we tried to run an experiment similar to the experiment outlined in the [[KELLEY_1.PDF]] research paper. We noticed that the acrylic container was not level in the experimental setup. Today we added some cardboard shims and a level to level out the setup. 


This time, we are going to run an experiment similar to the one outlined in [[Digital Imaging of 2D Fluid Flow - SP22.pdf]]. 

The following parameters will be used:
	- Parameters:
		- 28 [g] of Copper Sulfate
		- 100 [mL] of Distilled Water
		- 190 [mL] of Glycerol
		- 110 [V] Supplied (Daisy Chained 4 power supplies)

When mixing this electrolytic solution, we initially started to do it by hand. However, we opted to use a heating plate with a magnetic stirrer to expedite the dissolving process. The hotplate was set to 115 $[\degree C]$  (just above the boiling point of water). The RPM of the magnetic stirrer was maxed out 1150 [RPM]. This allowed the solution to mix very well.


We  tried to run the experiment but there seems to be an issue with syncing the power supplies. When we daisy chain three power supplies together, we can control the voltage but the current is extremely low. I think there might be a resistance issue or the copper strips may be corroded. After spring break we will have to consult Dr. Zimmerman and see what he thinks the issue is.
