I gave an update presentation this morning on the current status of our project. I need to be careful and consistent in my convention for the magnet labeling and the orientation in which I show videos. Dr. Zimmerman had a good suggestion to help solidify our understanding of the system we are studying. He suggested trying to run an experiment without the magnets underneath to better understand what role the magnets play in dictating the flow of the fluid. 

When we ran an experiment without the magnets present, there was no visible flow within the glass beads on top of the fluid. This made sense since the Lorentz force is dependent on the magnet field.

To further solidify our understanding at the forces at play within the fluid, we walked through some brief calculations on the white board. Our main focus was the Lorentz force explained in [[KELLEY_1.PDF]]. Our overview can be seen in the image below which highlights the interactions between the fluid and the magnets. 

Lorentz Force Equation: $\overrightarrow{F}=\frac{\overrightarrow{J}\times\overrightarrow{B}}{\rho}$
* Variables:
	* $\overrightarrow{J}$  - Current Density ($\frac{A}{m^2}$)
	* $\overrightarrow{B}$  - Magnetic Field ($T$)
	* $\rho$   - Mass Density ($\frac{kg}{m^3}$)

Following that, we went back through to collect some more video data. In the past, the video on iPhone was pre-programmed to zoom in further than the photo settings. This was making it difficult to get a good view of the fluid system. Our solution to this was starting out in the photo section of the iPhone camera, holding down the photo button, and getting it to play a video from there instead.

The videos collected today can be seen below. We were able to daisy chain an additional power supply making the total five for the potential difference. This allowed us to get up to roughly 150 [V]
