Following our previous lab worktime, we noticed that our acrylic container that is intended to hold our electrolytic solution leaks at a decent rate. In order to prevent this from happening, we are going to line the inside seams with some epoxy to prevent any leakage. There is some leftover epoxy (*Loctite Epoxy Instant Mix*) from another group's experiment. However, we are not sure if it will be enough to seal all the edges of our container.

We tested to see what part of the container was leaking first before applying any epoxy. It was found that leaks were occurring. The image below has a red line outlining where the leak is occurring for both black pads. These black pads are used to place the copper strips in the solution.

Both sides were sealed with epoxy from the outside. The only challenging part about this is that we have to let the epoxy cure which prevents us from running the experiment today. Once the epoxy has cured, we will test and see whether or not the leakage has been fixed. Images of the epoxy applied can be seen in the two images below.

The rest of lab time was spent preparing to run the experiment next Tuesday in lab. When comparing the experiments conducted in the [[KELLEY_1.PDF]] research paper and the [[Digital Imaging of 2D Fluid Flow - SP22.pdf]] research paper, there were some key differences in the composition of their fluid of study. 
	- [[Digital Imaging of 2D Fluid Flow - SP22.pdf]] 
		- Parameters:
			- 28 [g] of Copper Sulfate
			- 100 [mL] of Distilled Water
			- 190 [mL] of Glycerol
			- 110 [V] Supplied (Daisy Chained 4 power supplies)
	- [[KELLEY_1.PDF]]
		- Calculated Parameters:
			- 28 [g] of Copper Sulfate (10% of the total solution mass)
			- 191.9 [mL] of Distilled Water
			- 47.97 [mL] of Glycerol (20% of the total solution volume)
			- The experiment outlined in the research paper used a power supply capable of 200 [mA] at 40 [V]. 
	- The key differences between these two experiments resides within the amount/ratio of distilled water and glycerol used and the voltage applied to the solution.
