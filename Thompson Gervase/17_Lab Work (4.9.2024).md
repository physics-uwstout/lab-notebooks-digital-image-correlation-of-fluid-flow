Today, we spent all of our time working on our research day poster so we did not collect any data.

We were able to get through the introduction, methods section, and part of the results section. Also got a good jump on the references section regrading all of the resources we used for this project. The start of the list can be seen below. 

This upcoming Thursday, we plan on finishing up this poster draft so that it is ready to send off.
