As of today, we are still waiting on some copper sulfate to actually run the experiment on our own for the first time.

Just to make sure that we didn't have enough copper sulfate, we decided to weigh out what we had on hand. As you can see in the image below, we have roughly 1.5 grams of copper sulfate on hand currently. We need at least 28 grams to run through the experiment based on the research papers from other groups in the past.

Since we have been spending so much time reading through these very fun/interesting research papers these past couple class periods, I decided to spend the rest of the time allowing Brendan learn more about coding. I should him what we had been doing in class regarding coding and AI. He spent the rest of the time working on his python skills with some lecture tutorials.
