The goal of today is to start preparing a Research Day Poster. We went online and found a template that we could use. Following this, we started to review previous research papers relating to our project topic in order to further refine what we want to highlight on our poster. 

We were able to get the specs on the magnets used in the experimental setup. This will be helpful when performing calculations with the magnetic field in the future.

* **Quantity Used:** 12
* **Dimensions:** 6" x 0.5" x 0.125"
* **Material:** NdFeB, Grade N42
* **Magnetic Field Strength:** 13,200 [gauss] = 1.32 [Tesla]


I also realized I was making a fundamental mistake when recording data from our power supplies. I was adding up the currents as if they were in series like the voltages and recording that total. Now that I have been refreshed on the fundamentals, I know that I just need to record the shared value shown on all the power supplies instead of adding them up. I felt pretty silly after I realized what I had been doing. Below are the numbers showing the correct relationship between voltage and current for our experimental setup in the table below.

| Voltage [V] | Current [mA] |
| :---------: | :----------: |
|     30      |      80      |
|     60      |     190      |
|     90      |     310      |
|     120     |     440      |
|     150     |     600      |
