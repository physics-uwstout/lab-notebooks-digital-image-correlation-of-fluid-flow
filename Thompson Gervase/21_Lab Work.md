Today, I worked on calculating the theoretical, measured, and corrected measured Reynolds numbers from the data we collected in the past. The code for those calculations can be found at the end of the [[Student Lab Notebooks/lab-notebooks-digital-image-correlation-of-fluid-flow/Thompson Gervase/Misc Files/PIV Guided Notebook.ipynb|PIV Guided Notebook]].

The rest of work time was spent working on the final research paper.
