Finally got some copper sulfate [[Copper_Sulfate.jpg]] to run the experiment(s). We went through and tried to construct the experimental setup in order to become more familiar with it. However, we noticed that our acrylic container leaks when fluid is placed in it. Next Thursday, we will try and line the edges with some epoxy to (hopefully) make the container water tight. When checking the LEDs, I goofed up and forgot that the order of the wires is important (since we are dealing with diodes) so I need to be more careful when setting them up.

When looking back at the [[KELLEY_1.PDF]], we reviewed the appropriate electrolytic solution ratios.
- Ingredients: Copper Salt (Copper Sulfate), Glycerol, Distilled Water
- 10% of the mass should be Copper Sulfate
- 20% of the volume should be glycerol (to increase viscosity)
To determine these values, I created a script to use in EES ([[Solution Calculations.EES]]). This determines the required volumes of distilled water and glycerol needed in reference to a specific amount of copper sulfate.
