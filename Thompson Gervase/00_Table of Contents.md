* [[01_Reading a Research Paper (2.6.24)]]
	* Summary: Learned how to read a research paper in class.
* [[02_Lab Work (2.8.2024)]]
	* Summary: Took inventory for our project and identified what items we need to run the project. Played with script to break down video files
* [[03_Lab Work (2.13.2024)]]
	* Summary: Continued to work through the [[Student Lab Notebooks/lab-notebooks-digital-image-correlation-of-fluid-flow/Thompson Gervase/Misc Files/PIV Guided Notebook.ipynb|PIV Guided Notebook]]. We also read through some additional research papers to get a better understanding of the experimental setup they used when conducting this experiment.
* [[04_Lab Work (2.15.2024)]]
	* Linked our lab notebooks in obsidian to GitHub. Still did not have all the equipment required to conduct the experiment so we continued to play with the particle tracking code.
* [[05_Lab Work (2.20.2024)]]
	* Summary: Continued to work through the [[Student Lab Notebooks/lab-notebooks-digital-image-correlation-of-fluid-flow/Thompson Gervase/Misc Files/PIV Guided Notebook.ipynb|PIV Guided Notebook]]. We took some time to get into the documentation from the developers of this script and took some notes on what they had to say ([[https://openpiv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]]). 
* [[06_Lab Work (2.22.2024)]]
	* Summary: Still waiting on copper sulfate to actually run the experiment. Spent our time during class refining our coding skills with basic examples and exploring AI examples.
