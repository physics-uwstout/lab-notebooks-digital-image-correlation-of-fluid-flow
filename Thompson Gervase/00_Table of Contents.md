 * [[10_Lab Work (3.7.2024)]]
	 * Summary: Tried to run an experiment similar to the one outlined in [[Digital Imaging of 2D Fluid Flow - SP22.pdf]]. However, there seems to be an issue with our driving circuit that we could not identify.
 * [[09_Lab Work (3.5.2024)]]
	 * Summary: Attempted running an experiment for the first time today. Went through all the setup for the experiment and mixed the proper solutions relative to the [[KELLEY_1.PDF]] research paper. The results did not turn out as good as anticipated. Learned some things that we will use to change next time.
 * [[08_Lab Work (2.29.2024)]]
	* Summary: Attempted to fix the leak in our acrylic container. Epoxy was used to seal some seams. Once the epoxy cures, we can run the experiment for the first time next week. To prep, we compared the experimental parameters of two research papers. There were some distinct differences that we will have to compare when we actually run the experiment.
* [[07_Lab Work (2.27.2024)]]
	* Summary: The copper sulfate arrived today!! We received a 1000 [g] container from thermo scientific. Started to build the experimental setup and we noticed that our acrylic base leaks when liquid is placed inside of it. This needs to be fixed before we can actually run the experiment. Also went through and tested all of our LED strips to make sure they work (all of them did).
* [[06_Lab Work (2.22.2024)]]
	* Summary: Still waiting on copper sulfate to actually run the experiment. Spent our time during class refining our coding skills with basic examples and exploring AI examples.
*  [[05_Lab Work (2.20.2024)]]
	* Summary: Continued to work through the [[Student Lab Notebooks/lab-notebooks-digital-image-correlation-of-fluid-flow/Thompson Gervase/Misc Files/PIV Guided Notebook.ipynb|PIV Guided Notebook]]. We took some time to get into the documentation from the developers of this script and took some notes on what they had to say ([[https://openpiv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]]). 
*  [[04_Lab Work (2.15.2024)]]
	* Summary: Linked our lab notebooks in obsidian to GitHub. Still did not have all the equipment required to conduct the experiment so we continued to play with the particle tracking code.
* [[03_Lab Work (2.13.2024)]]
	* Summary: Continued to work through the [[Student Lab Notebooks/lab-notebooks-digital-image-correlation-of-fluid-flow/Thompson Gervase/Misc Files/PIV Guided Notebook.ipynb|PIV Guided Notebook]]. We also read through some additional research papers to get a better understanding of the experimental setup they used when conducting this experiment.
* [[02_Lab Work (2.8.2024)]]
	* Summary: Took inventory for our project and identified what items we need to run the project. Played with script to break down video files
* [[01_Reading a Research Paper (2.6.24)]]
	* Summary: Learned how to read a research paper in class.
