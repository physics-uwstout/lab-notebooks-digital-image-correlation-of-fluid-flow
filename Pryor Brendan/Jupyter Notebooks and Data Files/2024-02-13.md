Today we started off by looking over all the code we needed to review and change what we needed for it to work for us. 
What is the signal to noise ratio and how do we get that sig2noise threshold value we use filter the plot?
Larger the arrow on the plot the faster it is moving.

**We Had to import those warnings to fix the code that was not working**
Python Code:
* import numpy, warnings 
* numpy.warnings = warnings 
We finished with the code in the Jupyter notebook and corrected everything we needed to to make sure the code works for the video we were running.

**Then we reviewed the research [[KELLEY_1.PDF]]
* RayLeigh number dimensionless number.
* Overview on an experiment that they ran which is very similar to our experiment.
* Went over the article to get a general understanding of what is going on in this experiment. Many of the equations and numbers are a bit confusing. 
* Suggests adding surfactant(dish soap) to help keep the glass beads on the surface.
