Today we plan on running the previous student's measurements with the experiment to see if we can get better results to see which experiment we want to run for the most part

On our last experiment we realized that our box not level on the table we put it on so today we leveled it out more so we could get better more even spread of the solution at the bottom to get better results.

We put the solution on the heating plate to heat it up to mix it easier and then used a magnetic stirrer to mix up the new solution using 28g of copper sulfate 190mL of glycerol and 100mL of distilled water.  We put heat plate on 1150 rpm and 115 degrees C.

We are having some issues daisy chaining the power supplies and getting power to the experiment to get results. We do not know what is going wrong but we are trying to fix it so we can go back to running the experiment. 

Could not figure out what was wrong with the power supply and the daisy chain we made to provide the power so we were not able to run the experiment. We could not get a current and a voltage at the same time. So we do not know what is wrong
