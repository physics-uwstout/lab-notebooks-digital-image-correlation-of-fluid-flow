Today we are playing with the code and changing the interrogation window size (winsize)
* Rule of thumb: Pick interrogation window sizes so that there are around 5 particles in a typical interrogation window
The search size which is the size of the interrogation window in the second frame(searchsize)
* typically 25% bigger than winsize
Then we did the overlap which sets how much adjacent interrogation windows overlap.(overlap)
* Common choices are between 50-75% of winsize
We then read over this website [Basics of the PIV algorithms â€” OpenPIV documentation](https://openpiv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/piv_basics.html) to get a better understanding on what the code was doing.

Velocimetry-The measurement of the velocity of fluids.

[OpenPIV Documentation](https://openpiv.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/stable/pdf/) Used this website to get a better understanding of what the overlap is which it is the number of pixels by which two adjacent windows overlap.

We could potentially change the quality of the video and the Frames per second(FPS)
