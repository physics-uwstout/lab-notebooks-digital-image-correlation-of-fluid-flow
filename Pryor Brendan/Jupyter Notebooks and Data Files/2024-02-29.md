We are going to start by using epoxy to seal up the leaks in the acrylic base then we will let that dry and go from there.

We then refilled it to see specifically where the leaks were so we could use the epoxy to seal up the leaks.

The leaks seemed to be around these two black pads so we are using the epoxy there to hopefully prevent the leaks.

We used epoxy to seal the two pads so that we could hopefully run the experiment by next class.

According to the previous students paper we need 28 grams of copper sulfate 100 mL of distilled water and 190 mL of glycerol. When using the research paper we calculated 28 grams of copper sulfate 47.97 mL of glycerol and 191.9 mL of water. so we are going to try both of these measurements and see which one of these provides us with the best results that we can measure and use. We are going to round up the two values to 48 mL of glycerol and 192 mL of water.
