Got some copper sulfate we a total of 8.48 grams.

We are trying to look into descaling the experiment to use the copper sulfate that we have to run the experiment.

We looked through some previous materials again to see if it was possible to scale it down for us to actually be able to run the experiment today.

We put together the experimental setup then we got some copper sulfate and we are using the power sources to power the LED lights. 

**We Got the Copper sulfate we needed a big container with plenty so we no longer have to descale the experiment and now we can run the experiment properly.**

Since we got the Copper Sulfate we needed we do not need to descale the experiment and we can hopefully run the experiment now.

All the LED strips worked and we now just checked the acrylic base and it has a leak so next lab we will try to epoxy the leaking parts to hopefully fix the leak.

The LED were light emitting diodes and so we had to make sure we plugged them in correctly so they could work and not stop the current.
