Today we should be able to run the experiment. There is still a small leak in the acrylic base but it should not be too bad and the solution might not even reach as high as where the leak is. 

Put together the experiment and put the box on now we need to power the LED light stripes on each side of the box. We also made the solution with about 28 grams of copper sulfate 191.9 mL of water and about 48 mL of glycerol. We are now working on making sure everything is powered and works well so we can run our experiment. We also need a way to provide electricity to the solution so we are gathering materials for power and setting up the experiment. 

We ran our experiment we think we put too many glass microspheres on top and the solution was not moving as we got farther into the experiment and the glass started to even out on top of the solution.

Experiment set up

***Our first run was 40 volts and We got this video [[40 Volts 1.mov]]***

***Then our second run at the experiment was 60 volts for this video [[60 Volts 1.mov]]***

Overall I think it was a good first run on the experiment and we learned how we can run the experiment better and more efficiently the next time we come to Lab.
